# CreateVirtualHost
**Bash script to create apache2 virtualhost for local server. Optionally creates mysql db, user.**

Tested on Ubuntu, but should work where dependency met.

Not for production, for development purposes only.

Use `yad` for gui and `pkexec` for root permissions in gui version, also depends on `notify-send`, but it optional.
All available in main ubuntu repo.

Launch from terminal or install dependences and launch gui version(by .desktop file for example). GUI version can create .desktop shortcut with some values defined as defaults in shortcut

**Install and usage**

Download and unpack in desired installation directory. For command line usage make symlink to virtualhost-cli.sh in any bin folder in PATH. For gui usage install dependency by `sudo apt-get install yad notify-send` and run `virtualhost-yad.sh`, change values to desired defaults and click "save defaults" - this will create application shortcut as desktop file in local user application folder.
Default localhost need to be configured as explained in next section, configs generated by script will
start work only after that.

    sudo ./virtualhost-cli.sh --subdomain=Website [...other options...]
        Creates virtualhost website.localhost with document root
        in /home/user/Web/Website/

    ./virtualhost-yad.sh
        Opens dialog to define config for virtualhost and mysql

**Default virtualhost**

Apache2 configured to catch up all request by default virtualhost config file, so custom virtualhost
configs not take place. Default located at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and need to be
disabled by `sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` or edited to match one site(domain) but not a wildcard:
(instead of localhost any domain name can be used)

    ServerName      localhost
    ServerAlias     localhost

**DNS record**

DNS record should match all subdomains and point to servers apache. For local development /etc/hosts can be used
and looks like:

    127.0.0.1 localhost *.localhost

where "*.localhost" must match all virtualhost sites created by script. Other domain can be used and specified
with --domain=_example.com_ argument to script

       virtualhost-cli.sh
              Create configuration and folder for virtual host, then reload apache.
              Do  not  create  DNS  record for domain, so works best with something
              like *.localhost in /etc/hosts

              specified), not system  wide.  Shortcut  to  virtualhost-yad.sh  with
              default  parameters, and can be called by it one to make new shortcut
